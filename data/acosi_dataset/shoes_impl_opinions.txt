i was excited to order a pair of these classic shoes
i had a pair many years ago when they were originally introduced
feel how shallow the toe box is on the new versions
now thinner than previous versions
i liked to go to the new balance store and purchase my shoes but you closed the store
i first noticed how hard
come in 4e width
needs a much broader selection of colors tho
standard and prominent shoe , i would expect there to be a size 12 . 5
deeper toe box
needed comfortable shoes throughout my 12 shift

falling apart as well in the back
i only had the shoes for 5 months
they were just lifestyle shoes not for sports
i was hoping for a more off - white almost light tan color shoe
but so much wider
i really like
hard to find shoes that fit a women ' s size 14
with other new balance ' s , i never had this issue
looked like clown shoes
wish that they came in high top
i had the original " careless " ultraboost and i am still wearing them for all i do in the gym but wanted that same comfort on the street

good because i have knee problems
i would not run in them but that ' s not what these are meant to be
more comfortable insoles would make a huge difference
however , seems quite roomy and wide in the toe area and i have wide feet
pleasantly surprised that reebok still made these
the size has gotten smaller by a whole size
frayed on the ankle upper sides

so now the laces are flopping around and the shoes are not useable
i have ordered boosts in 9 . 5 before and they fit perfect
it ' s annoying to buy sneakers online anyway
when size isn ' t common even amongst the same brand it is excruciatingly annoying
love the look
makes it very uncomfortable
20min toes were tingling
feet were hurting
legs were aching
i wish they would bring back the the 790 , now that was the best shoe ever
very narrow leg
maybe it ' s cause i ' m used to wearing more flexible shoes
purchased based on the website guidance they were wide
very comfortable
usually the 8 . 5 wides from new balance fit me perfectly
not these
don ' t have the size
don ' t have my size in m 8 . 5
my foot dr suggested these
a lot more comfortable
my podiatrist recommended new balance for flat feet so
wear as casual shoe
i like a little variety
bought for my daughter
figured out why she doesnt like to wear them
hoping crocs can do something for me
i purchased for my grandson had to be returned
they were defective because the back strap that fits , normally , around the back of the ankle was ridiculously short and did not fit around
measuring them against another pair of the same crocs he had that i wanted to replace , they were at least one inch shorter
was returned
just not how delicate they are with the pattern
my son love these

thankfully made in america
more for someone who needs extra foot protection than for someone who wants to be physically active
was denied a change
unfortunately , this was the only walking shoe
will have to wait for stores to reopen
so disappointed as new balance 8w has always fit in the past
i guess it was just the way this shoe was designed
two previous pair were purchased in a retail store
purchased on line
coming off when i got them new
i had never experienced this with the same shoe before
maybe it is due to the new recycled material i believe
definitely used before
i have never got so many compliments on a pair of shoes before
niche to have this
definitely used and worn

i love crocs and that was the only issue i had with this pair in particular
i thought the sneakets were orange on both sides
no means to adjust them to get them to fit right
are comfortable shoes though
i am usually very pleased
this shoe is for narrow feet
this is the only shoe i ' m comfortable buying on line
the size is consistent so i know it will fit like my last pair ( s )
i usually wear a size 7 but i order this shoe in a 7 1 / 2 .

i would have given sneaker a 5 out of 5 if the shoe laces were longer
if it weren ' t for the size problem , they would have been fine
does not " roll " as you walk like the earlier version
they were finally wearing out , so i replaced them
this is the only shoe i can wear since my ankles roll outward
how easy it is to order by mail , but i continuously find it frustrating that sales
never include any of the 3 models i buys - that frustration is the only reason i did not award 5 stars
i replaced my previous set of tennis shoes ( same shoe ) that previously lasted more than a year
seems to increase the potential of turning my ankle to the outside

the quality of the new balance products is slipping over the years
i think this has to do with the constant " out - sourcing " to foreign countries for production
not as good as some of the older new balance shoes i bought 5 years ago
had no chance either the actual retailer
never had that problem with the original
