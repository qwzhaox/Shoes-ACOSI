first of all this is a replacement to my iphone xr which had many faults . i really like the new iphone and it works much better than its predecessor . it includes features like live wallpapers and real haptic touch and my favourite double camera . if you want an iphone that is amazing for a good price get the new se or the xr ( mine was a one off i presume ) but if you have more money to spend buy the iphone 11 or up . thanks apple####[['new iphone', 'overall#overall', 'positive', 'really like'], ['amazing for a good price', 'price#value for money', 'positive', 'NULL']]
no the iphone 7 came all complete with battery installed , charger etc , it was 128 gb model and i paid ? 210 . if it had been refurbished i could not tell 12 months of daily use and battery still shows 100 % capacity . hope this helps the refurbished iphone 7 that i bought is 4 years old and has a perfectly good battery , so i i saw no reason to replace it . in fact , this replaced an old iphone 5s , which still had the original battery . if i am not mistaken , apple say that a battery should be good for 500 charge / discharge cycles when my phone came my battery health was at 100 % so i assume they do hi there , i recently bought a reconditioned iphone from amazon which was complete with battery and have never heard of amazon selling an iphone without one . hope this helps . cheers . frank . no the phone retains charge easily for a full day although i am not heavy user yes . i am 98 % they are new####[['battery', 'battery/longevity#general', 'positive', 'perfectly good'], ['battery health', 'battery/longevity#battery life', 'positive', '100 %'], ['128 gb', 'product configuration#memory', 'neutral', 'NULL'], ['100 % capacity', 'battery/longevity#battery capacity', 'positive', 'NULL']]

this is certainly not expected behaviour with our galaxy a52 5g ! we would recommend performing a soft reset by pressing and holding the volume down and power button at the same time until your phone reboots , then check for any software updates through settings > software update > download and install . if the display issue continues , please don ' t hesitate to contact our support team through the ' support ' page on our samsung uk website . we hope this helps ! ^ lp at samsung support####[['display', 'screen#general', 'negative', 'issue']]
usually go for high spec branded android phones however decided against an upgrade and thought i ' d try a cheap throwaway phone as broke my handset . what can i say ? the phone came with a case and screen protector attached , feels light and good quality . the camera is great and does the job , the phone is fast and responsive . some features are a little different but you soon find them or get used to them . i would highly recommend it and at such a low price you can afford to take a chance####[['throwaway phone', 'price#price', 'positive', 'cheap'], ['screen protector', 'product accessories#cell phone film', 'positive', 'attached'], ['case', 'product accessories#phone cases', 'positive', 'attached'], ['quality', 'product quality#general', 'positive', 'good'], ['camera', 'camera#general', 'positive', 'great and does the job'], ['phone', 'overall#overall', 'positive', 'fast and responsive'], ['recommend', 'buyer attitude#recommendable', 'positive', 'highly'], ['price', 'price#price', 'positive', 'such a low'], ['feels light', 'appearance design#grip feeling', 'positive', 'NULL']]

the s21 ultra is my second return to samsung in the last five years . the first being the note 20 ultra that only lasted a week due to poor battery life in comparison to the oneplus 8 pro as clearly the chipset was lacking ; however the s21 ultra is a different beast and on this occasion samsung have got it spot on . the lack of fast charging in less than an hour and no charger in the box are the only flaws i have found thus far . truly impressed with samsung ' s effort this time around . split screen plus watching netflix , youtube and amazon prime is very pleasing on this device as the audio is spot on . bixby routines is a must for every phone and i can only hope this feature develops more each build . simply put , if you can afford it , get it as you won ' t be disappointed .####[['battery life', 'battery/longevity#battery life', 'negative', 'poor'], ['only lasted', 'battery/longevity#power consumption speed', 'negative', 'a week'], ['fast charging', 'battery/longevity#charging speed', 'positive', 'in less than an hour'], ['no charger in the box', 'product accessories#charger', 'negative', 'only flaws'], ['device', 'overall#overall', 'positive', 'very pleasing'], ['audio', 'audio/sound#volume and speaker', 'positive', 'spot on'], ['disappointed', 'overall#overall', 'positive', "won ' t"]]
