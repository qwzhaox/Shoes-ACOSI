i believe all phones turn off after a period of no use . . . it is called screen time out , if you go into the settings features on any phone it will have screen off time or 1 minute to maybe 15 minutes or you can disable this feature so your screen is constantly on but this will reduce your battery time . hope this helps . . . open settings > lock screen > sleep . . . ( change sleep time to 10 minutes ) this will give you longer time before phone automatically sleeps which is a feature to save power ? mine hasn ' t done that so maybe it ' s a fault####[]

yes , it should do . if you have a choice i would get the full sim card that you can " breakdown " into 3 different sized sims . i can ' t remember which size sim it takes , i think the middle size one ( no idea of the names of the different sizes ) . i can ' t check because my husband uses the phone and he is out for a walk in the somewhat cooler air ! i hope that helps . yes i see no reason why not . it is an unlocked phone so should take any sim . hi , as long as the phone is unlocked , then it should take any service provider , but i have never tried it .####[]

no you can play pubg at extreme 60 fps in smooth setting . . but if you want to get 90 fps and ultra graphics available then you have to download some " config file " for pubg . but trust me it is the real truth about 90 fps that this phone doesn ' t support 90 fps , if you get 90 fps by default in pubg , only that means your phone support it . . otherwise the poco x3 pro also doesn ' t support 90 fps . . if you want to enjoy pubg then play in smooth with extreme , it doesn ' t give you any kind of lag ( also it depends on server network of pubg )####[]

hello . i ' m not sure , but the charging cable has a completely different end compared to models 5 and 11 . as far as i remember , the model 5 had a wide end for the charging cable and the model 11 has a narrow one , see on the internet . greetings as far as aware the 5 uses a different socket to the 11 lightening type , a cable is included so shouldn’t be a problem , may be worth your while to buy a standard usb to c type adapter as the supplied cable is c type to lightening , a charging cable comes with it yes it’s a lightning cable on this one too yes yes it will do the job####[]

hi , the volume control on the phone is the long bar on the left side , as you look at the screen . top of the bar increases the volume ; bottom , decreases it , when depressed . i can control the phone volume by simply going to setting _ sounds _ phone _ volume then slide + - if you have already gone into ' settings ' and you have no joy , go into the ' green telephone app ' , from there go into ' settings ' at the top right , then go to sounds and vibration , from there just increase each line setting . hope this works for you . i must admit my volume is low . the only control is on the left hand side . should have a button on side of phone####[['volume', 'audio/sound#volume and speaker', 'negative', 'low']]
