upgraded from the 7 plus . i was really excited to get the new iphone as i’ve wanted to upgrade for a while but put off by the price tag . first impression was “oh , that’s it” i expected it to be bigger . it was smaller than my 7 plus , looked more square like an old iphone 4 but heavier . straight away , the first thing i noticed was how yellow the screen was so i turned off the auto brightness and messed with a few other setting but was still annoyed by how yellow and dull it looked . i tried taking the same photos with the 12 pro and my 7 plus and actually preferred the colour and quality of my old phone’s photos . i even emailed myself the photos to have on the device to ensure it wasn’t just the yellowness of the screen that made them look bad and it wasn’t . not impressed at all and not worth the money so i have returned my first ever iphone .####[['colour', 'appearance design#color', 'positive', 'actually preferred'], ['quality of my old phone’s photos', 'shooting functions#general', 'positive', 'actually preferred'], ['screen', 'screen#general', 'negative', 'yellow'], ['bigger', 'appearance design#fuselage size', 'positive', 'NULL'], ['smaller', 'appearance design#fuselage size', 'negative', 'NULL'], ['heavier', 'appearance design#weight', 'negative', 'NULL'], ['not impressed at all and not worth the money', 'overall#overall', 'negative', 'NULL']]

was very happy until ( after 6 months ) phone produced an error message ( " dm - verity corruption " ) that the supplier ( uf mobile ) said meant that it needed to be repaired . supplier wanted me to pay to send the phone from uk to china , and to lie on the customs declaration , to state that it was a gift and with a value significantly less than it was worth . i refused , and complained to amazon , who organised a complete refund - so 5 stars for amazon ' s service , and somewhat fewer for uf mobile . phone itself was fine while it lasted , but the boot - up error message came out of the blue and gave me no confidence it wouldn ' t happen again after repair or replacement .####[['phone', 'overall#overall', 'positive', 'fine while it lasted'], ['boot - up error message', 'performance#general', 'negative', 'came out of the blue']]

this will depend on your phone contract not the phone . best speak to your service provider . it would probably depend on the sim card that you have ask your network provider i’m guessing as it’s a mobile phone it can be used in any country . if you message the seller i’m sure they can give you the answer i would think it’s more to do with your sim rather than your phone hope this helps####[]

i love technology and new gadget but i think the companies manipulate us into thinking we need the newest products every year , so you spend more money . this phone is great . budget price , just updated to the latest android os . the camera takes photos worthy of a much higher spec phone . the screen is clear and bright and comes with an under screen fingerprint sensor . only down side is there ' s only one built in speaker so the sound isn ' t great . also it ' s positioning means you can sometimes cover it when holding the phone trying to listen . that being said , must of the time i use headphones or a bt speaker so it isn ' t a problem . as i said very decent phone for the price , large screen . i ' ve bought them for my partner and mum when they needed upgrades .####[['phone', 'overall#overall', 'positive', 'great'], ['price', 'price#price', 'positive', 'budget'], ['camera takes photos', 'shooting functions#general', 'positive', 'worthy of a much higher spec phone'], ['screen', 'screen#clarity', 'positive', 'clear and bright'], ['under screen fingerprint sensor', 'system#lock screen design', 'positive', 'comes with'], ['speaker', 'audio/sound#volume and speaker', 'negative', "there ' s only one built in"], ['sound', 'audio/sound#tone quality', 'negative', "isn ' t great"], ['phone for the price', 'price#value for money', 'positive', 'very decent'], ['screen', 'screen#size', 'positive', 'large']]

very glad i bought the mini as i’ve since tried a friends full size 12 and it’s way to big for my hands ( which are large for a woman ) . this is my 4th apple phone , it’s everything i would expect i just hope it doesn’t get made obsolete as quickly as my last ( the mic and camera just stopped working after the latest ios update ) . my only wings is the that the facial recognition feature being released a year after coronavirus lockdown 1 , not recognising your face in a mask or giving you fingerprint alternative is far from ideal . you have to key in your passcode . i feel fingerprint tech should have been kept given the shortfall in facial recognition####[['bought', 'buyer attitude#shopping experiences', 'positive', 'very glad'], ['full size', 'appearance design#fuselage size', 'positive', 'way to big for my hands'], ['camera', 'camera#general', 'negative', 'just stopped working'], ['mic', 'audio/sound#volume and speaker', 'negative', 'just stopped working'], ['not recognising your face in a mask or giving you fingerprint alternative', 'system#lock screen design', 'negative', 'far from ideal'], ['facial recognition', 'system#lock screen design', 'negative', 'shortfall']]

this could and should be a good phone . unfortunately there are too many niggling issues . main one is the location of the finger print sensor - on the side , just where you hold the phone , so it ' s always trying to activate . also , the sensor is too sensitive - the lightest of touches is all it needs . and then there ' s the ridiculous ' find on page ' tool in android that is activated by the finger print sensor , so it ' s forever interrupting web use . other major issue with this phone is screen rotation - quick to happen but ages to reorientate . overall , a mistake to have chosen this .####[['location of the finger print sensor', 'system#lock screen design', 'negative', 'always trying to activate'], ['sensor', 'system#lock screen design', 'negative', 'too sensitive'], ['screen rotation', 'screen#general', 'negative', 'quick to happen but ages to reorientate'], ['finger print sensor', 'system#lock screen design', 'negative', 'forever interrupting web use']]

probably the best way to use your smart tv with your phone is to use a ' chromecast ' device . i tried a direct screen cast from phone to tv but could not get it to work . maybe other users have had more success and can give better advice . yes it connects to my samsung tv through google nest mini , but you can also cast from your phone . this phone does have the ability to " cast " your screen and certain apps such as youtube , netflix , amazon video to any devices that allow for this function . if your tv is not compatible you can purchase a chromecast for an additional ? 40 which can turn your samsung tv into a smart tv to allow this function you require .####[]

when i first bought the phone it was operating well . after 3 months , it started crashing and generally was very slow . then battery issues started appearing . i fully charged the batter and the other day when woke up it was 30 % - 50 % down without having used it at all , during the night . now the phone is overheated very ofter even when i do not run many apps . it is worryingly heated up , so i have to switch it off in order to cool it . yesterday , during the night the battery went from 90 % to 1 % without having it used at all and the phone was off in the morning . i am very disappointed from this phone and i consider it very dangerous to carry it with me when overheated . would not recommend it to anyone .####[['phone', 'overall#overall', 'negative', 'very disappointed from'], ['heated up', 'performance#heat generation', 'negative', 'worryingly'], ['battery', 'battery/longevity#battery capacity', 'negative', 'went from 90 % to 1 %'], ['battery issues', 'battery/longevity#general', 'negative', 'started appearing'], ['crashing', 'performance#general', 'negative', 'started'], ['would not recommend', 'buyer attitude#recommendable', 'negative', 'NULL'], ['overheated', 'performance#heat generation', 'negative', 'NULL']]

as a ' phone it works but for anything else it is useless . i bought it to replace a 12 year old nokia , which is coming to the end of its life however it doesn ' t do half the things the old ' phone did & i ' m now back to limping that along . i didn ' t want a smart ' phone but something small enough to carry in a pocket while dog walking or horse riding . this is a real disappointment . sending a text is a nightmare as it has no predictive text & doesn ' t even automatically insert capital letters so takes about 3 times as long as with my old faithful . it also lacks many useful tools such as a timer . i ' m afraid it ' s relegated to a draw for the foreseeable future .####[['phone', 'overall#overall', 'positive', 'works'], ['phone', 'overall#overall', 'negative', 'useless'], ["do half the things the old ' phone did", 'overall#overall', 'negative', "doesn ' t"]]

i upgraded from an iphone 6s to an iphone xr too but my sim fitted perfectly . try rotating the sim so it’ll fit in . the iphone xr takes a nano sim or esim . i’d talk to your provider about getting a new sim and then see if you can transfer your number and contacts . hope that helps ! yes - you need micro sim - usually pops out of existing sim card ( plastic push out ) i’m probably not the best person to ask this but a micro sim card should be fine . if you can’t get that from your current sim card then you may need to change it .####[]

of course you can - you can on any fingerprint device . the device does not know who the fingerprints belong to so 10 different people could record their prints and all 10 could unlock the phone . if you are asking whether they get logged into their own personal ' account ' on the phone ( as some tablet devices do ) then no it doesn ' t do that . yes my husbands is set for him and myself . the original owner goes to settings and it gives choice to set up another fingerprint . i also put about 3 on my ipad so if my pad is in different position more chance of getting it right first time or if i hurt my finger have another one to use you must be able to since you can set up more than one finger , and the phone doesn’t k ow to whom they belong ! hello…yes you can . i’m sorry i don’t know but i don’t think so .####[]

if i could give this no stars i would . the slowest phone created , throws you out of apps ( many apps built in and can ' t be deleted ) and unresponsive . won ' t support chat heads for social media due to conserving battery life and struggles to get wifi / mobile data when no issues with any other phone . fully charging the battery took around 4 hours and only lasted 12 hours with minimal use . spare yourself and do not buy this phone . i ' ve purchased other blackview phones in the past , all with no issues , unfortunately after my experience i won ' t be using them again . phone lasted less than a month before it stopped charging properly . 3 and a half hours to reach 10 % . thankfully i ' ve been offered a full refund once sent back .####[['many apps built in', 'system#application', 'negative', "can ' t be deleted"], ['wifi', 'signal#wifi signal', 'negative', 'struggles to get'], ['mobile data', 'signal#signal of mobile network', 'negative', 'struggles to get'], ['lasted 12 hours with minimal use', 'battery/longevity#power consumption speed', 'negative', 'only'], ['blackview phones', 'overall#overall', 'positive', 'with no issues'], ['charging properly', 'battery/longevity#general', 'negative', 'stopped'], ['fully charging the battery', 'battery/longevity#charging speed', 'negative', 'took around 4 hours'], ['do not buy', 'buyer attitude#recommendable', 'negative', 'NULL'], ['3 and a half hours to reach 10 %', 'battery/longevity#power consumption speed', 'negative', 'NULL']]

really this should be a 4 star review but there are 2 points that loose it stars . 1 ) the bluetooth audio connectivity has occasional brief hiccups ( looses 1 star ) 2 ) the phone has a factory installed " basic service " app , with this app installed the phone would get a 1 star review as this app tries to save a small amount of memory and battery power ( not needed on a phone with 8gb ram and 10 , 000 mah battery ) , in doing so it adds annoying popups and makes various apps unusable as it kills them off after 10 minutes of the screen locked . luckily if you know what you are doing you can de - install it to get a usable phone and thus looses another star for that fact you have to de - install this app .####[['bluetooth audio connectivity', 'smart connect#bluetooth connection', 'negative', 'occasional brief hiccups'], ['factory installed " basic service " app', 'system#application', 'positive', 'save a small amount of memory and battery power'], ['factory installed " basic service " app', 'system#application', 'negative', 'adds annoying popups and makes various apps unusable'], ['8gb ram', 'product configuration#operating memory', 'neutral', 'NULL'], ['10 , 000 mah battery', 'battery/longevity#battery capacity', 'neutral', 'NULL']]

after 3 months this should be taken up with the person or company from whom it was purchased ; they have to issue a refund or repacement if the device is faulty or not fit for purpose ( they then pass it back to who they bought the thing from and so on ) . this is the law ( google ' sale of goods act 1979 ' and see the government guidance ) . if you encounter any problems or reluctance with the seller ask amazon to act as an intermediary to secure your refund / replacement . your contract of sale is with the vendor . likely amazon in this case . you could contact their customer services or alternatively xiaomi uk directly via their website .####[['device', 'overall#overall', 'negative', 'faulty or not fit for purpose']]
