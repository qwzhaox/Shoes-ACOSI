Just as the name implies, it's a great Daily shoe . Simple, comfortable and a cool take on the traditional Adidas style . I actually didn't realize they were skater shoes at first, but that's fine .

Liked the shoes . I left them outside and the next day they had shrunk by about 3 full sizes . I assume it was from the heat from the sun .

Purchased a brand new pair of 990's from my local New Balance store a couple of months ago . Terribly disappointed . These shoes squeak when I walk .

I have narrow feet and typically Adidas shoes fit better than other brands . These are wider than I like, but because they are flexible I can pull the laces tight to adjust the fit .
