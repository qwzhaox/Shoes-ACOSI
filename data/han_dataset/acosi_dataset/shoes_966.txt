Great shoe but the sizing was a little off . Need about a half size bigger . Hard to give an honest assessment on an item that doesn't fit perfectly . Shoe no longer available so I cannot exchange for bigger size .####[['shoe', 'General', 'positive', 'Great', 'direct'], ['shoe', 'Performance#Sizing/Fit', 'negative', 'but the sizing was a little off', 'indirect'], ['NULL', 'Performance#Sizing/Fit', 'neutral', 'Need about a half size bigger', 'direct'], ['item', 'Cost/Value', 'neutral', 'Hard to give an honest assessment on an item', 'direct'], ['Shoe', 'ContextOfUse#Purchase\\_Context', 'negative', 'no longer available so I cannot exchange for bigger size', 'indirect']]
Love these shoes . They are amazing . But after about 200 miles the upper started to rip on the medial side near the big toe . Seems they should last longer than that . I also rotate with 1080s so they don't get everyday use . The thin upper is good, but too thin ?####[['shoes', 'Cost/Value', 'positive', 'Love these', 'direct'], ['NULL', 'General', 'positive', 'They are amazing', 'direct'], ['NULL', 'ContextOfUse#Usage frequency', 'negative', 'But after about 200 miles the upper', 'direct'], ['NULL', 'Performance#Durability', 'negative', 'Seems they should last longer than that', 'direct'], ['NULL', 'ContextOfUse#Usage frequency', 'negative', "I also rotate with 1080s so they don't get everyday use", 'indirect'], ['upper', 'Appearance#Shoe Component', 'negative', 'The thin upper', 'indirect']]
I ordered my size but for ME they run small . I wore them just to see if I could break them in . . . I wouldn't advise that ! So give yourself some wiggle room and order the 1/2 .####[['NULL', 'Performance#Sizing/Fit', 'negative', 'I ordered my size but for ME they run small', 'direct'], ['NULL', 'ContextOfUse#Usage frequency', 'negative', "I wore them just to see if I could break them in . . .

Love the look of Stan Smith shoes, however, I am not a fan of the recycled material they now use . Should have leather options for those of us that still prefer them .####[['Stan Smith shoes', 'Appearance#General', 'positive', 'Love the look', 'direct'], ['Stan Smith shoes', 'Appearance#Material', 'negative', 'however , I am not a fan of the recycled material they now use', 'direct'], ['leather', 'ContextOfUse#Purchase\\_Context', 'negative', 'Should have leather', 'direct']]
If you're looking for a comfortable and stable running shoe that is durable, you have come to the right place . Super cushioned, breathable upper, great fit that is true to size . I have tried Hokas and these are more comfortable IMHO . I downgraded them to a 4 star only because I think that they are sort of plain looking and I would like to see these shoes offered in more stylish looks .####[['running', 'Performance#Comfort', 'positive', "If you're looking for a comfortable and stable running", 'direct'], ['NULL', 'Appearance#Material', 'positive', 'Super cushioned , breathable upper', 'direct'], ['NULL', 'Performance#Comfort', 'positive', 'these are more comfortable IMHO', 'direct'], ['NULL', 'Appearance#General', 'neutral', 'I downgraded them to a 4 star only because I think that they are sort of plain looking and I would like to see these shoes offered in more stylish looks', 'indirect']]
