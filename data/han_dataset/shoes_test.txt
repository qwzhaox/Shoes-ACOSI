Purchased a brand new pair of 990's from my local New Balance store a couple of months ago . Terribly disappointed . These shoes squeak when I walk .

I have narrow feet and typically Adidas shoes fit better than other brands . These are wider than I like, but because they are flexible I can pull the laces tight to adjust the fit .
