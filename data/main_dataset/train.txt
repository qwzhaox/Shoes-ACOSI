I have noticed that the quality of the New Balance products is slipping over the years and I think this has to do with the constant " out - sourcing " to foreign countries for production .

I have several pairs of NewBalance shoes which all fit well and are very comfortable . I have only worn these NM306RST twice and the left is very tight in the toe box and created a blister between two toes . I can no longer ware the shoes . Hopefully NewBalance will help and has a solution .####[['newbalance shoes', 'ContextOfUse#Use case', 'Positive', 'i have several pairs of newbalance shoes which all fit well and are very comfortable .', 'indirect'], ['nm306rst', 'ContextOfUse#Review\\_Temporality', 'Negative', 'i have only worn these nm306rst twice', 'indirect'], ['nm306rst', 'Performance#Sizing/Fit', 'Negative', 'left is very tight in the toe box', 'indirect'], ['toe box', 'Appearance#Shoe Component', 'Negative', 'left is very tight in the toe box', 'indirect'], ['nm306rst', 'Performance#Comfort', 'Negative', 'created a blister between two toes', 'indirect'], ['shoes', 'Performance#General', 'Negative', 'i can no longer ware the shoes', 'indirect'], ['newbalance', 'ContextOfUse#Purchase\\_Context', 'Neutral', 'hopefully newbalance will help and has a solution', 'indirect']]
