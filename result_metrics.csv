There is no room in front of shoes . I remove my tag so I can't return too .,"['fengbo', 'chang']",2,0.1111,0.0,0.5,0.2195,0.5,0.26612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33330000000000004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.25
I thought I would like this shoe but unfortunately I didn't . Fit very small im originally a size 9 and it fits small would suggest to go up a size . Thought it would help my heel problem but only made it worse .,"['fengbo', 'chang']",1,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.3125,0.5,0.7625000000000001,0.16670000000000001,0.16670000000000001,0.16670000000000001,0.16670000000000001,0.33330000000000004,0.16670000000000001,0.16670000000000001,0.16670000000000001,0.33330000000000004,0.16670000000000001,0.16670000000000001,0.5,0.16670000000000001,0.33330000000000004,0.16670000000000001,1.0,0.16670000000000001,0.5,0.16670000000000001,0.33330000000000004,0.16670000000000001,1.0,0.5,0.16670000000000001,1.0,1.0,0.5,0.16670000000000001,1.0,1.0,1.0
